# Simulation of particle energy deposition in the Detector
# --------------------------------------------------------
#
# - The particle is propagated in small steps through the DriftChamber.
#
# - For each cell, that is hit, I get an Hit object in the DataStore, that knows 
#   how much energy the particle deposited in that cell.
#
# - In the graphical representation, hit cells are drawn with a different symbol, 
#   than cells which have not been hit.
