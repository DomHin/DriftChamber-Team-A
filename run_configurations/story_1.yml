# Feed Run Engine with simple modules
# -----------------------------------
#
# - I'm able to add modules, e.g. HelloWorldModule and ByeByeWorldModule to the RunEngine
#
# - These modules print out some text in their event functions
#
# - I can specify nEvents with a method of the RunEngine and ask it to run, then the event
#
#   function of each module is executed, this is repeated nEvent times
