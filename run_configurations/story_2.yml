# Basic Geometry [e.g. based on lists] creation and depiction
# -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# - I can add a geometry module to the RunEngine. I can specify via argument(s) the number
#   of SuperLayers, for each SuperLayer the number of Layers, and the width of the drift
#   chamber in total (which is global as every layer has the same width). Each layer is
#   filled with Drift Cells of width "1". The geometry is supposed to be created only once
#
# - I have a simple graphical depiction of the chosen geometry. Different SuperLayers can 
#   be shown either by different colours or different symbols for the cells.
